        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Checkpoint backup software and related services (the "Service") provided by Fluxcode Studio LLC ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. License</h2>
        <p>Checkpoint is licensed under the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polyform Noncommercial License 1.0.0</a>. You may use the Service for any noncommercial purpose. Commercial use requires a separate license from Fluxcode Studio LLC. The source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/fluxcodestudio/Checkpoint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/fluxcodestudio/Checkpoint</a>.</p>

        <h2>2. Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
        <p><strong>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</strong></p>
        <p>Checkpoint is backup software. While we strive to make it reliable, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No guarantee of data integrity.</strong> We do not guarantee that your backups will be complete, accurate, uncorrupted, or recoverable. Backup processes may fail silently, produce incomplete copies, or encounter errors that are not reported.</li>
            <li><strong>No guarantee of availability.</strong> The daemon may stop, crash, or fail to run. Scheduled backups may not execute. Cloud sync may fail, stall, or lose data in transit.</li>
            <li><strong>No guarantee of encryption.</strong> While Checkpoint offers encryption features, we do not warrant that encryption is correctly implemented, free of vulnerabilities, or sufficient to protect your data from unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>You are solely responsible for your data.</strong> Checkpoint is one layer of a backup strategy. You should maintain independent backups through other means. Do not rely on Checkpoint as your only backup system.</li>
            <li><strong>You are responsible for your cloud credentials.</strong> If you configure cloud sync, you are responsible for the security of your cloud provider credentials, storage buckets, and access controls.</li>
            <li><strong>You are responsible for your encryption keys.</strong> If you enable encryption, you are solely responsible for safeguarding your encryption key. Lost keys cannot be recovered by Fluxcode Studio LLC, and encrypted backups will be permanently inaccessible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL FLUXCODE STUDIO LLC, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of data, source code, databases, credentials, or files</li>
            <li>Loss of revenue, profits, business, or anticipated savings</li>
            <li>Loss of goodwill or reputation</li>
            <li>Cost of procurement of substitute services</li>
            <li>Business interruption or downtime</li>
            <li>Unauthorized access to or alteration of your data</li>
            <li>Any damages resulting from backup failure, corruption, or incomplete restoration</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>THIS LIMITATION APPLIES REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</strong></p>
        <p>In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. In no event shall our total aggregate liability exceed the amount you paid for the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or fifty US dollars ($50), whichever is greater.</p>

        <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement</li>
            <li>Any warranty that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free</li>
            <li>Any warranty that backups will be complete, accurate, or recoverable</li>
            <li>Any warranty that the Service will meet your requirements or expectations</li>
            <li>Any warranty regarding the results obtained from use of the Service</li>
            <li>Any warranty that defects will be corrected</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Fluxcode Studio LLC and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or related to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your use or misuse of the Service</li>
            <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>
            <li>Your violation of any third-party rights</li>
            <li>Any data loss or corruption associated with your use of the Service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Service for any commercial purpose without a separate commercial license</li>
            <li>Modify, redistribute, or sublicense the Service in violation of the Polyform Noncommercial License</li>
            <li>Use the Service to store, backup, or transmit any content that violates applicable law</li>
            <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or derive source code from compiled components (the shell scripts and source code are already open source)</li>
            <li>Remove or alter any copyright, trademark, or attribution notices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Updates and Changes</h2>
        <p>We may release updates, patches, or new versions of the Service at our discretion. We are under no obligation to provide updates, support, maintenance, or bug fixes. We may modify or discontinue the Service (or any part of it) at any time without notice or liability.</p>

        <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Checkpoint integrates with third-party services (cloud storage providers, database engines, etc.). We are not responsible for the availability, security, or terms of any third-party service. Your use of third-party services is governed by their respective terms and policies.</p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>You may stop using the Service at any time by uninstalling it. We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time for any reason, including violation of these Terms, without notice or liability.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Delaware.</p>

        <h2>11. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

        <h2>12. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any applicable license agreement, constitute the entire agreement between you and Fluxcode Studio LLC regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.</p>
