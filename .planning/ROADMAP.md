# Roadmap: Checkpoint

## Overview

Transform the existing backup infrastructure into a fully automatic, invisible system. Starting with cloud folder destination (leveraging Dropbox/GDrive desktop sync), add activity-based triggers with debouncing, integrate with Claude Code events, implement fallback chains for reliability, add tiered retention for efficient storage, and finish with dashboard/monitoring for visibility.
